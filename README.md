A simple and clean website made with classic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. One of my first websites. 
Its main feature is the dynamic progress bar that I coded. You can control all the details of the bar,
like the speed of progress can be associated to a variable, the color, shape and size and almost anything 
you can think of. Use it anyway you see fit :)

The code was meant for an application called Zero-Touch provisioning and to see its progress through a progress bar
and numerous steps on the bar.

How it looks:
